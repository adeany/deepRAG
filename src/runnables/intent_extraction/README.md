# Intent Extraction and Classification

Potentially explore multi-step intent classification with [LARA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16504).
Look into zero and few shot techniques for classification as shown [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07157).
Use findings to improve results from [this publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02136).
Use [this research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13063) on taxonomies and intent classification.
Use [multi-label](https://www.esann.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/legacy/es2016-174.pdf) techniques for classification.
