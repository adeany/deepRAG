# Graph retrieval

Use [this repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/templates/neo4j-cypher-ft) for information on graph retrieval with cypher generation.

See applicability of [this article](https://research.google/blog/talk-like-a-graph-encoding-graphs-for-large-language-models/) regarding graph shapes for graph queries.

Research [graphRAG](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator) for querying cluster summaries for neighborhoods within a graph.
